# Covid_Data_Analysis
The project contains analysis of COVID-19 historical dataset, providing correlativity between vaccination rates, population, new cases and total death 
for each country in the world. 

Data is also partitioned for continental analysis. Finally, insights are visualized as a dashboard containing variety of graphs on my Tableau Public profile.
